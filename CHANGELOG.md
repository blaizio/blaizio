# Changelog

All notable changes to the Blaizio packages (`Blaizio.Base`, `Blaizio.Icons`, `Blaizio.Cli`) and
the registry-distributed `Blaizio.Ui` source. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com); versions are lockstep across packages while
pre-release.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Cli**: `add --update` and `add --upgrade` merged into `add --update`, which now does both:
  bump the Blaizio NuGet packages to the tool's pinned versions, then re-pull the installed
  components (all of them, or just the ones you name). The split shipped a foot-gun: components
  lean on the package's JS/CSS assets, so a source-only sync could pair new components with an
  older package (a component importing a `dist/` module its package doesn't carry fails at
  runtime). `--upgrade` remains as a hidden alias so existing scripts keep working. The v1 → v3
  migration now bumps the packages too.

### Fixed
- **Base**: closing a floating surface no longer throws `ObjectDisposedException` when the close
  races the component's own disposal - e.g. a dropdown-menu item that navigates: the menu's exit
  animation reports back while navigation is already tearing the component down, and both paths
  disposed the same JS positioning reference. Every floating surface's dispose helpers (dropdown
  menu, popover, tooltip, combobox, select, dialog content + overlay, hover card, collapsible,
  table of contents) now claim their reference synchronously before awaiting - the second caller
  no-ops - and swallow `ObjectDisposedException` alongside the existing circuit-gone guard.
- **Ui**: `--input` gained contrast against its surface in every palette - the light value dropped
  from lightness `0.91` to `0.88` and the dark value rose from `0.325` to `0.36`. Input borders,
  and everything else deriving from the token, now read as an edge rather than a suggestion.
- **Ui**: interactive states that leaned on `--muted` over `--background` (barely two percent
  apart in light mode) moved to `--accent`, so they are actually visible: pagination link hover,
  outline-toggle hover, and the outline/ghost bubble action hovers. Data-table column-header
  hover moved to the existing `color-mix(..., var(--foreground) 5%)` hover step in the skins that
  had no visible treatment (ember, spark, forge, wisp, aura, flint).
- **Ui**: the pagination link's active page shows its border again. The shared
  `[data-active="true"]` rule and each skin's base `.bz-pagination-link` rule carry the same
  specificity, so the skin's `border-transparent` - imported later - silently won and the current
  page lost its outline in every skin. The active treatment now lives in the skin rules.
- **Ui**: `BzDataTable` row clicks are delegated in JS, so a click can be attributed to its
  target. Clicking a row now toggles that row's selection when `Selectable`, while clicks that
  originate inside an interactive cell control (the selection checkbox, a row-actions trigger, a
  link) stay that control's own. `OnRowClick` gains the same treatment, finally honouring its
  documented "anywhere outside an interactive cell control" contract - as a Blazor `@onclick` on
  the `tr` it had fired for every click that bubbled out of the row.
- **Base**: a tooltip trigger opens on focus only when the focus is *keyboard* focus
  (`:focus-visible`). Focus also lands on a trigger programmatically - a dropdown or dialog
  sharing that trigger restores focus there when it closes - which popped the tooltip open under
  a pointer nowhere near it. Keyboard users still get the immediate, no-delay open, including
  when Escape closes an overlay back onto the trigger.

## 0.1.0-alpha.6 — 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- **Base**: the `.blaizio/` contract now materializes **before** the CLI-wired Tailwind compile.
  Both hook `BeforeBuild`, but the Tailwind target lives in the project file and package targets
  import after it, so on a fresh clone or worktree the Tailwind compile ran first and failed on
  the missing `.blaizio/` imports before the contract could materialize. The materialize target
  now also declares itself before `BlaizioTailwindFetch`/`BlaizioTailwindBuild` - a fresh checkout
  heals on its first `dotnet build`, no manual copying.
- **Ui**: `BzPieChart`, `BzRadarChart`, and `BzRadialBarChart` tooltips gained the edge-aware
  placement `BzChart` already had - near the chart's start/end the panel hugs that edge instead
  of centring, and with no room above it flips below the anchor - so cards that clip overflow no
  longer cut the tooltip. The single-row pie/radial panels also dropped their forced minimum
  width so they fit beside small charts.

### Added
- **Base**: opt-in theme-scope portal frames. An ancestor with
  `data-bz-portal-frame="some classes"` makes its portaled surfaces re-home into a shared
  `<body>`-level `display: contents` container carrying those classes instead of bare `<body>`,
  so ancestry-scoped CSS (theme pins, scoped skins) survives the portal move. The frame is
  created on demand and removed when its last surface leaves; nested portals resolve to the same
  frame.

### Changed — floating surfaces portal to the body
- **Base**: every floating surface — tooltip, popover, hover card, dropdown menu, context menu,
  menubar menu, select, combobox, and the declarative dialog/alert-dialog/sheet/drawer content and
  overlay — now **moves itself to `document.body` while open** and returns to its place in the DOM
  before unmounting. A surface declared inside an ancestor that creates a stacking context
  (`position: fixed`/`sticky` with a z-index, `transform`, `filter`, `backdrop-blur`,
  `container-type`, `opacity` below 1) or an overflow clip can no longer be painted over or cut at
  that ancestor's edge. Positioning, focus, dismissal, and animations are unchanged; submenus stay
  inside their (portaled) parent surface. No setup: upgrade `Blaizio.Base` and re-pull components.
- **Breaking (styling)**: because the open surface is a `<body>`-level node, **ancestor CSS
  selectors no longer reach it** (e.g. `.my-panel .bz-tooltip-content { ... }` or a parent's
  `[data-theme]` scope). Style floating content through its own classes/attributes, target
  `:root`, or set `Inline` (below) to restore in-place rendering. Theme, skin, and dark classes on
  `<html>` are unaffected.

### Added
- **Base/Ui**: `Inline` parameter (default `false`) on every floating content component —
  `BzTooltipContent`, `BzPopoverContent`, `BzHoverCardContent`, `BzDropdownMenuContent`,
  `BzContextMenuContent`, `BzMenubarContent`, `BzSelectContent`, `BzComboboxContent`,
  `BzDialogContent`, `BzDialogOverlay`, `BzAlertDialogContent`, `BzSheetContent`,
  `BzDrawerContent` (and their `Base*` counterparts). `Inline="true"` renders in place (today's
  pre-alpha.5 behavior) — for CSS-containment parents, print, or tests that assert on local markup.
- **Base**: a portaled surface stamps its own `dir` attribute from the cascaded
  `BzDirectionProvider` direction, so a subtree-scoped RTL keeps applying to body-level surfaces.

## 0.1.0-alpha.4 — 2026-07-16

### Changed — CSS layout v3
- **Registry/Ui**: component classes are now **inlined per skin** at registry build — `blaizio
  build` merges the shared + skin `@apply` lists (TailwindMerge semantics) and substitutes every
  `bz-*` token in the shipped `.razor`/`.cs` source, emitting per-skin variants under
  `r/{style}/`. No skin stylesheet ships to consumers; `bz-*` classes are gone from output.
- **Base**: ships the static contract (`blaizio.css` — `data-*` variants, keyframes,
  chart/toast machinery — plus the vendored `animate.css`) and `buildTransitive` MSBuild targets
  that **materialize them into the consumer's gitignored `.blaizio/`** before every build.
  Opt out with `<BlaizioMaterializeContract>false</...>`, redirect with `<BlaizioContractDir>`.
- **CLI**: v3 layout throughout — `init` scaffolds ONE user-owned tokens file
  (`Styles/app.css`: Tailwind input, `:root`/`.dark` values with preset/chart/radius/fonts baked
  as plain editable values, `@theme inline` map) and only ever patches it surgically afterwards.
  `add` pulls the recorded skin's inlined variants; a full `apply` (skin swap) re-installs the
  ledgered components (confirm-gated); `update` has no styling leg left; `uninstall` strips by
  record. New config keys: `css`, `cssCreated`, `ejected`.
- **CLI**: `update` runs the confirm-gated **v1 → v3 migration** when it sees the old
  `Styles/blaizio/` layout: components re-install from the skin's inlined variants first, the
  tokens file is composed from the project's v1 sheets (user values survive; preset/fonts/pointer
  folded in), then `Styles/blaizio/` is deleted.
- **Ui**: `--primary-button` retired — the default button's dark fill derives from `--primary`
  via a `color-mix` formula (WCAG AA-verified across presets).
- **Docs**: v3 story (Installation/Theming/CLI rewritten), per-skin Source view on component
  pages, Get Code dialog emits the merged comment-free token block.

### Added
- **CLI**: `blaizio eject` — copies the materialized contract into the tokens file, drops the
  `.blaizio/` imports and sets `"ejected": true`; the styling plumbing is frozen and yours.
  Confirm-gated, irreversible, clean no-op on a second run.
- **CLI**: `blaizio contrast` — WCAG AA audit of the tokens file's color pairs (light + dark,
  focus ring at 3:1, the derived dark button fill); exits `1` on failures, `--json` for CI.

### Changed
- **CLI**: a `/create` code's chart palette and radius now bake directly into the tokens file's
  `:root` (exact-declaration rewrite). The selection is recorded in `blaizio.json` (`chart`,
  `radius`) so `update`/`apply` re-runs keep it. `apply --only tokens` patches values in place.
- **CLI**: `preset resolve` round-trips the full `/create` code, including fonts, chart and
  radius.

### Fixed
- **Ui**: accordion/collapsible close blink — the `@theme` animation shorthands in `blaizio.css`
  dropped the `--tw-animation-fill-mode` hook, so the exit animation ran with `fill-mode: none`
  and the closed panel snapped back to full height until the unmount landed. The shorthands now
  carry `var(--tw-animation-fill-mode, none)`, letting the `[data-state='closed']` forwards pin
  hold the final frame.

## 0.1.0-alpha.3 — 2026-07-14

### Fixed
- **Base**: collapsible/accordion panels re-measure their content height while open
  (`MutationObserver` + window-resize, rAF-throttled) — content that grew after opening
  (async loads, expanding composers) no longer causes the close animation to start from a stale
  height. The measurement also lifts the inner wrapper's height pin first so fresh content can't
  report the old value back.

### Changed
- **CLI**: tool bumped in lockstep; installs pin `Blaizio.Base`/`Blaizio.Icons` `0.1.0-alpha.3`.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2 — 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- **Ui/Base**: floating-surface close blink (dialogs, dropdowns, popovers) — exit animations now
  hold their final frame via `[data-state='closed'] { --tw-animation-fill-mode: forwards; }` in
  `shared.css`, so a slow unmount round-trip can no longer flash the surface back to visible.

### Added
- **CLI**: `apply [preset]` (preset name or `/create` code, `--only theme,fonts,tokens`);
  `preset decode/resolve/url/open`; `registry add/validate` with `@namespace/component`
  resolution; `docs <components...>`; commander-style help (`BlaizioHelpProvider`); `add`
  absorbed `--update/--upgrade/--diff/--view`; `search` absorbed `list`.
- **CLI**: `uninstall` (formerly `deinit`) is undo-by-record — components, NuGet packages,
  `@using`s and config are removed exactly as tracked in `blaizio.json`; user files survive.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1 — 2026-07

Initial pre-release.

- **Blaizio.Base**: headless primitives (behavior, ARIA, keyboard, `data-state` contract) with
  TypeScript interop shipped as `_content/Blaizio.Base/dist/*` — consumers copy no JS.
- **Blaizio.Icons**: Tabler icons as a tree-shakeable SVG component.
- **Blaizio.Ui**: 61 styled Tailwind v4 components, 8 skins, 9 color palettes, RTL via logical
  properties, light/dark token model — distributed as source through the registry.
- **Blaizio.Cli**: `init` (templates incl. Showcase, Tailwind v4 wiring with standalone-binary
  auto-fetch or bundler detection, host-page patching), `add` (transitive registry dependencies,
  namespace rewrite, install ledger), `search/view/info/docs`, `build` (registry compiler),
  sha256-verified Tailwind standalone downloads, per-user binary cache, `--json` contract on
  every command.
- **Docs**: component documentation site hosting the registry (`/r`) and the `/create`
  configurator with shareable preset codes.
